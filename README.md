# Minibuild

Minibuild is a collection of portable build scripts made for various classes of software packages.

Inspired by [AOSC-Dev/autobuild3](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/autobuild3).

If things go well, we will move some complexity of package building from
[Diel](https://github.com/sashimios/spm-bash/tree/master/src/diel)
to this project.



## Installation

```
make install_local
```

This will install the entire `static` directory as `/usr/local/lib/minibuild/static`.
